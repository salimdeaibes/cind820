I will provide relevant notes for the submission here.

The link to the dataset used is: https://data.ontario.ca/en/dataset/status-of-covid-19-cases-in-ontario/resource/ed270bb8-340b-41f9-a7c6-e8ef587e6d11
For the previous part of the project, it was suggested to me to use cross validation instead of random splitting (for train/test portions) - however, we notice that cross validation (where the number of folds, e.g. 2,3,4-fold cross validation) do not provide different results so we omit this from our submission. However, we mention it in the readme to mention that it was considered.

The repository contains (the read me), an ipynb (interactive python notebook) showing how we obtain our graphs analyzing our Covid data set (namely, it shows comparisons between several pairs of attributes as well as corresponding regression analyses)
